# A DNS Server in Rust
This is my repo which follows the DNS server guide found [here](https://github.com/EmilHernvall/dnsguide) by [Emil Hernvall](https://github.com/EmilHernvall). 

The original guide puts all the code into one `main.rs` file, so I refactored it into the rust mod system hiearchy.

You can check out their [hermes](https://github.com/EmilHernvall/hermes) repo, if you want to see what a polished finished result looks like!

# License
The original repo doesn't specify a license, so I'm using the [MIT license](LICENSE); which the `hermes` repo also uses.
